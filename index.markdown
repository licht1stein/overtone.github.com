Overtone is an open source audio environment being created to explore musical
ideas from synthesis and sampling to instrument building, live-coding and
collaborative jamming.  We use the
[SuperCollider](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/) synth server as the audio
engine, with [Clojure](http://clojure.org) being used to develop the
APIs and the application.  Synthesizers, effects, analyzers and musical
generators can be programmed in [Clojure](http://clojure.org).

Come and join the [Overtone Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/overtone) if you want to get involved in the project or have any questions about how you can use Overtone to make cool sounds and music.

## Cross Platform

Overtone runs on Linux, OSX, and Windows.  The only core dependency is [Java](http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp). In most cases Overtone will provide a version of SuperCollider as part of its dependencies. However, you are also able to connect to an existing external version obtained [here](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/). Finally Linux users should have a version of the [jack](http://jackaudio.org/) audio server installed

## Future Plans

We've got big ideas for Project Overtone, and we can use all the help we can
get.  For example, we plan to build a visual data flow editor similar to [PureData](http://puredata.info/) or Max/MSP. Also, we'd like integrate with a peer-to-peer network that allowing for
collaborative composition and jam sessions over the internet and sharing of
instruments and effects. Checkout the [roadmap](/roadmap.html) for more information about our future plans.

Please get in touch and start a conversation if you are interested in joining in.
