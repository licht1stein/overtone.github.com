Overtone is an open source audio environment being created to explore musical
ideas from synthesis and sampling to instrument building, live-coding and
collaborative jamming.  We use the
[SuperCollider](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/) synth server as the audio
engine, with [Clojure](http://clojure.org) (and Java) being used to develop the
APIs and the application.  Synthesizers, effects, analyzers and musical
generators can be programmed in [Clojure](http://clojure.org) or designed in a
visual data flow editor similar to [PureData](http://puredata.info/) or Max/MSP.
The environment will be integrated with a peer-to-peer network that allows for
collaborative composition and jam sessions over the internet and sharing of
instruments and effects.

Checkout the [roadmap](/roadmap.html) for more information about what we're up
to, and join the [Overtone Google
group](http://groups.google.com/group/overtone) if you want to get involved in
the project.

#### Cross Platform

Overtone runs on Linux, OSX, and Windows.  You just need to have [SuperCollider](http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/)
and [Java](http://java.com/en/download/index.jsp) installed to run it (plus the
[jack](http://jackaudio.org/) audio server in Linux).
